## A Multilingual Integration

A **LCZ4r-QGIS plugin** repository that integrates the **LCZ4r package** with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) in multiple languages. It facilitates the integration of the [General Functions](https://bymaxanjos.github.io/LCZ4r/articles/Introd_genera_LCZ4r.html) and [Local Functions](https://bymaxanjos.github.io/LCZ4r/articles/Introd_local_LCZ4r.html) from LCZ4r package into QGIS, allowing users to analyze Local Climate Zones (LCZ) and urban heat islands directly within the QGIS environment.

```

## Key Features
* Seamless Integration: smooth interaction between QGIS and the LCZ4r package, enabling users to leverage R's statistical and graphical capabilities within the QGIS interface 

* User-Friendly Interface: accessible for users familiar with QGIS, making complex analyses simpler to execute without requiring extensive programming knowledge.

* Urban Climate Analysis: tools for analyzing and visualizing Local Climate Zones and urban heat islands.

## Translation plugin process
The translation process evolves three levels:

### Human Translation
The functions and documentations of the LCZ4r were translated manually by experts familiar with Climatology, LCZ and GIS.

### AI-Assisted, Human-Reviewed Translation
Translations initially performed by AI and then reviewed and refined by human experts familiar with Climatology, LCZ and GIS.

### AI-Only Translation
All functions and corresponding documentation of the LCZ4r package were fully translated using AI, without human review.
