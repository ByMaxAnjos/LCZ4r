## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following:

-   **QGIS**: A popular open-source Geographic Information System, which can be downloaded [here](https://qgis.org/).
-   **R**: The R environment for statistical computing, which must be installed separately. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## ðŸ—ƒ Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### 1. Install the R

The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R environment is essential for running LCZ4r scripts within QGIS. Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), following the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### 2. Install the Processing R Provider in QGIS

[Processing R provider](https://north-road.github.io/qgis-processing-r/) plugin allows you to run R scripts directly in QGIS, using data from your GIS projects. Follow these steps to install it:

1.  Open **QGIS** and go to **Plugins** \> **Manage** and Install **Plugins**.
2.  Search for "Processing R Provider" and click **Install**.
3.  Once installed, ensure the plugin is activated in **Plugins** \> **Installed**.


### 3. Download the LCZ4r Scripts

To integrate LCZ4r functionality into QGIS, you need to download the R scripts for your preferred language:

-   Visit the [LCZ4r-QGIS Integration Page](https://bymaxanjos.github.io/LCZ4r/articles/Introd_QGIS_LCZ4r.html#key-features) and download the script package.

-   Unzip the downloaded file and save the scripts in a location you can easily access.

**Languages available**: LCZ4r supports multiple languages. Be sure to download the correct version for your needs.

### 4. ðŸ”§ Configuring QGIS to Use LCZ4r

1.  Open **QGIS** and navigate to **Processing** \> **Toolbox**.

2.  Locate the **R scripts** folder in your **Processing** options and add the path where you saved the LCZ4r scripts.

3.  Test your setup by running a sample LCZ analysis script. If everything is configured correctly, you should see the LCZ output in your QGIS workspace.
