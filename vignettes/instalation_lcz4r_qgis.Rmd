## ðŸš€ Getting Started: Installing LCZ4r in QGIS

Welcome to the **LCZ4r-QGIS plugin installation guide!** This document will guide you through the setup process to enable Local Climate Zone (LCZ) analysis within QGIS. With LCZ4r, you can enhance urban climate analysis by integrating advanced R functionalities directly into your GIS environment.

## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following:

-   **QGIS**: Download and install [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), a popular open-source Geographic Information System.
-   **R**: Download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical computing, which is essential for running LCZ4r scripts within QGIS.

## ðŸ—ƒ Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### 1. Install the R

The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics, required for running LCZ4r scripts. Follow these steps:

* Got to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download and install R, following the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). 
* **Tip**: Ensure R is properly configured in your systemâ€™s PATH so that QGIS can communicate with it.

### 2. Install the Processing R Provider in QGIS

The [Processing R provider](https://north-road.github.io/qgis-processing-r/) plugin allows you to run R scripts directly in QGIS. To install it:

1.  Open **QGIS** and go to **Plugins** \> **Manage** and Install **Plugins**.
2.  Search for "Processing R Provider" and click **Install**.
3.  Once installed, ensure the plugin is activated in **Plugins** \> **Installed**.

### 3. Download and install the LCZ4r Scripts

To integrate LCZ4r functionality into QGIS, you need to download the R scripts for your preferred language:

* 1. Visit the [QGIS-LCZ4r Integration page](https://bymaxanjos.github.io/LCZ4r/index.html).
* 2. Download the R scripts in your preferred language [(e.g., English)](https://bymaxanjos.github.io/LCZ4r/articles/english_lcz4r_qgis.html)
* 3. Unzip the downloaded file and save the scripts in an easily accessible location.
* 4. Open **QGIS** and got to **Settings** \> **Options...** \> **Processing** \> **Providers** \> **R**.
* 5. Under **R scripts folder**, add the path where you saved the LCZ4r scripts.
* 6. Disable **Use user library instead of system libraries**.
* 7.Click **OK** to confirm your setup.

If everything is configured correctly, you will see **LCZ4r General Functions** and **LCZ4r Local Functions** in the *Processing Toolbox* \>*R* below Example Scripts.

### 4. Run your first LCZ4r Script

Start by running the **Download LCZ Map** function under *LCZ4r General Functions*. This step will install any additional necessary packages; it may take a few minutes, so please be patient.

ðŸ’¡ **First-Time Setup**: The first script run may take longer as it installs all dependencies.

ðŸŒŸ *Once the process is complete, you should see the output LCZ map. Congratulations! Youâ€™re now ready to enjoy the functions of the LCZ4r-QGIS plugin*.
