The **Local functions of LCZ4r** are specialized tools designed to analyze large datasets, such as hourly air temperature readings. This tutorial focuses on using data from Berlin, collected across 23 meteorological stations as part of the [Urban Climate Observatory (UCO)](https://www.tu.berlin/en/klima/institutions-and-services/urban-climate-observatory)

## Overview

The **Local functions in `LCZ4r`**, offer powerful tools to handle and analyze urban climate data. They enable time-series analysis, mapping of thermal anomalies, spatial interpolation, and more. Below is a summary of these functions:

| Function              | Description                                | Data Required | Internet Access Required |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `lcz_ts()`            | Analyze LCZ Time Series                    | Yes           | Optional               |
| `lcz_anamoly()`       | Calculate LCZ Thermal Anomalies            | Yes           | Optional                 |
| `lcz_anamoly_map()`   | Map LCZ Thermal Anomalies                  | Yes           | Optional                 |
| `lcz_interp_map()`    | Perform LCZ Interpolation                  | Yes           | Optional                 |
| `lcz_plot_interp()`   | Visualize LCZ Interpolation                | Yes           | Optional                 |
| `lcz_uhi_intensity()` | Assess LCZ for Urban Heat Island Intensity | Yes           | Optional                 |


Tips: 
1. Utilize the help(lcz\_\*) function to access detailed documentation for each LCZ4r function. For example, to learn about the lcz_ts function, type help("lcz_ts") in the console.
2. Each LCZ4r function supports imputation for handling missing values within data frames. For more information on imputation methods, refer to the "impute" argument in the documentation of each function.

## Data Input Requirements

To ensure smooth operation of the local functions, input data should be structured as a data frame with the following columns:

1.  *date*: This column should contain date-time information. This column must labeled "date".
2.  *Station Identifier*: A column for identifying meteorological stations.
3.  *Air Temperature or other variable*: At least one column representing the air temperature or any other target variable.
4.  *Latitude* and *Longitude*: Two columns for the geographical coordinates of each station.

Ensure that the date-time format aligns with R's conventions (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). Acceptable formats include "1/2/1999" or "1999-02-01"

To simplify this setup, LCZ4r provides a sample data frame, which you can load with the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(LCZ4r)

#Load data from LCZ4r package
data("lcz_data")

#Check data structure out
str(lcz_data)

```

```{r echo=F, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig_local_1.png")
```

## Customizing Local Functions in LCZ4r

You can further customize the Local Functions to suit specific analysis needs:

**1. Flexibility time selection**
LCZ4r provides options to filter data by specific years, months, and days to narrow down your analysis period. For example, you can:

1. Select a range of years (e.g., 1998:2004) or specific years (e.g., c(1998, 2004)).

2. Filter by month, either by numeric values (e.g., 1:6 for January to June) or by names (e.g., c("January", "December")).

3. Pinpoint a specific date, such as September 1, 2019, by setting the *year*, *month*, *day* and *hour* as arguments.

4. Pinpoint a specific period, by setting *start*=1/9/1986 and *end*=1/9/2024, as arguments.

For more information, see the [utility functions from the openair package](https://bookdown.org/david_carslaw/openair/sections/utilities/utility-functions.html#sec-selectByDate).

**2. Splitting LCZ time series by temporal window or site**
You can segment the LCZ time series data using the *by* argument, allowing for analysis across different temporal windows or sites. Available split options include:

1. Temporal segments: "year", "season", "seasonyear", "month", "monthyear", "weekday", "weekend".

2. Daylight split: "daylight", which divides data into daytime and nighttime periods.

3. You can use also c("daylight", "month"), c("daylight", ""season")
