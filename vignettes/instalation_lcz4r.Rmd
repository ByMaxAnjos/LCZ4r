## 🚀 Getting Started with LCZ4r

Welcome to the **LCZ4r package!** This guide will walk you through the installation process and help you get started with the latest features.

## 🗃️ Installation in R

To install the **LCZ4r package**, use the development version from GitHub. This ensures you have access to the latest features and improvements.

### Step 1: Install the remotes Package

If you don’t already have the remotes package installed, run the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
```

### Step 2: Install LCZ4r from GitHub

Use the remotes::install_github() function to install the LCZ4r package:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ByMaxAnjos/LCZ4r", upgrade = "never")
```

### Step 3: Install LCZ4r from GitHub

Once installed, load the package to start using its functions:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(LCZ4r)
```

## ⏳Installation Notes

* **First installation:** The first installation may take a while as all dependencies (packages required by LCZ4r) are installed on your system.
* **Upgrate:** The upgrade = "never" argument ensures that package dependencies are not upgraded. If you want to upgrade dependencies, replace "never" with "always". Note that this may extend the installation time.
* **Regular updates:** We recommend reinstalling the package periodically to leverage the latest improvements and bug fixes.

## 💡Tips for a Smooth Experience

* **Check Dependencies**: Ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed.
* **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter any issues during installation, check the GitHub Issues page for solutions or to report new problems.

Thank you for using LCZ4r! We hope this package enhances your workflow and helps you achieve your goals. Happy coding!🎉
